# Autograd

Autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and Numpy code. It can
handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops, ifs, recursion and
closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It
uses reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), which means it can
efficiently take gradients of scalar-valued functions with respect to
array-valued arguments. The main intended application is gradient-based
optimization. For more information, check out the [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)
and the [examples directory](examples/).

Example use:

```python
>>> import autograd.numpy as np  # Thinly-wrapped numpy
>>> from autograd import grad    # The only autograd function you may ever need
>>>
>>> def tanh(x):                 # Define a function
...     y = np.exp(-x)
...     return (1.0 - y)  / ( 1.0 + y)
... 
>>> grad_tanh = grad(tanh)       # Obtain its gradient function
>>> grad_tanh(1.0)               # Evaluate the gradient at x = 1.0
0.39322386648296376
>>> (tanh(1.0001) - tanh(0.9999)) / 0.0002  # Compare to finite differences
0.39322386636453377
```

We can continue to differentiate as many times as we like:

```python
>>> grad_tanh_2 = grad(grad_tanh)           # 2nd derivative
>>> grad_tanh_3 = grad(grad_tanh_2)         # 3rd derivative
>>> grad_tanh_4 = grad(grad_tanh_3)         # etc.
>>> grad_tanh_5 = grad(grad_tanh_4)
>>> grad_tanh_6 = grad(grad_tanh_5)
>>>
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> x = np.linspace(-7, 7, 200)
>>> plt.plot(x, map(tanh, x),
...          x, map(grad_tanh, x),
...          x, map(grad_tanh_2, x),
...          x, map(grad_tanh_3, x),
...          x, map(grad_tanh_4, x),
...          x, map(grad_tanh_5, x),
...          x, map(grad_tanh_6, x))
>>> plt.show()
```
